**Subject:** arXiv Endorsement Request – Thermodynamic Constraints in Transformers

---

Dear [Professor/Dr. Name],

I am writing to request your endorsement for submitting a manuscript to arXiv in the cs.LG (Machine Learning) category.

**Paper Title:** Thermodynamic Constraints in Transformer Architectures: A Sheaf-Theoretic Perspective

**Summary:**
The paper presents empirical evidence for thermodynamic-like constraints governing transformer architectures. Key findings include:

1. Kleiber's Law for Transformers (r = −0.878, p = 0.004) – maximum gain scales as G_max = 10^(1/L)
2. Training Heritage Dominance (p < 0.001) – training methodology determines thermodynamic behavior more than architecture
3. Direct validation via Sheaf Laplacian computation with 26× discriminating power between model families

The work is validated across 23+ models from 7 independent labs (EleutherAI, Meta, BigScience, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, TII).

**Why cs.LG:**
- Establishes quantitative scaling laws for transformer dynamics
- Provides mechanistic interpretability framework
- Actionable implications for model selection and architecture design

**About me:**
I am a researcher at IU International University of Applied Sciences. This is my third paper in a series on transformer dynamics; the first two are published on Zenodo with DOIs (10.5281/zenodo.18110161, 10.5281/zenodo.18142454).

**Materials:**
- Preprint PDF: [Zenodo link after upload]
- Reproducibility: All experiments use PYTHONHASHSEED=42, timestamped via OpenTimestamps

I would be grateful if you could consider endorsing this submission. If you have any questions about the work, I would be happy to provide additional details.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Davide D'Elia

## Who to Ask for Endorsement

**Ideal endorser profile:**
- Has published in cs.LG or cs.CL on arXiv
- Works on: mechanistic interpretability, transformer theory, sheaf/category theory in ML
- Has endorsed before (check their arXiv history)

**Potential contacts (research-based):**

| Name | Affiliation | Relevance |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Authors of Pythia paper | EleutherAI | Direct model family |
| Sheaf Neural Networks authors | Various | Theoretical framework |
| Transformer Circuits authors | Anthropic | Mechanistic interpretability |
| Scaling laws researchers | Various | Empirical methodology |

**Finding endorsers:**
1. Look at recent cs.LG papers on related topics
2. Check if authors have "endorser" status (papers with many submissions)
3. Academic Twitter/X – many ML researchers respond to polite requests
4. Conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR) – workshop organizers often endorse
